# ⛲ Solidity Staking Tech Developed keeping the Web3 DApp in perspective

This repository contains a **Solidity-based Token Staking Tech** designed for secure,automated contract Deployment. Built for real-world usability, this contract enables users to claim tokens at fixed intervals, supports advanced configurations, and integrates smoothly with Web3 DApps and EVM-compatible chains.

---

## 🔧 Development & Testing

The contract is compatible with:

- Local EVM environments
- **Hardhat** for modern testing, deployment, and scripting workflows
- **Remix IDE** for quick prototyping and debugging

---

## 🚀 Key Features

✅ Fully compliant with **IERC20** standard  
⏳ **Contract Developed for staking IERC20 tokens and specifically to be integrated with the Web3 DApp of one of my Projects**  
⚙️ Multiple events of view functions which are responsible for fetching data from the Blockchain via Contract
🔐 Security checks for re-entrancy and abuse prevention  
🧠 Gas-optimized logic and minimal external dependencies  
👑 Ownable for administrative control(Can be added)
🗓️ Adjustable **The Time period for staked tokens and the Owner of the contract**  
🌐 EVM-compatible deployment (Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, etc.)

---

## 📦 Installation & Usage

### ⚙️ Deployment

```bash
# Make sure your deployer wallet has ETH/native gas token
# Then compile and deploy using Hardhat or Remix
Compile StakingTech.sol

Deploy to your target EVM chain

Configure Contract deployment(Params)

Staked tokens are locked based on the time period specified in the contract storage
📌 Supported Chains
Ethereum (Mainnet, Sepolia, etc.)

Binance Smart Chain (BSC)

Polygon (Matic)

Avalanche

Any EVM-compatible chain

🌐 Web3 Integration
This contract can be integrated into any Web3 DApp UI to:

Display contract Deployed status

The token staked by the wallets are all mapped

The wallets which staked the tokens are tracked

Their timePeriod is tracked

The claimStatus of the wallets who staked is also tracked.

Trigger contract deployed transactions

Monitor the number of claims made

Handle wallet connections and user feedback

💡 Future Enhancements
🔁 Can be integrated with Web3 for a fully functional DApp.
